Build
=====
* Add deployment documentation
* Add coverage analysis (cobetura and flex cover)
* Add PMD and FlexPMD source code static analysis
* Add FindBugs bytecode static analysis (Java only)
* Add a report directory and have better reporting on testing, etc. (using junitreport and failure properties)


High Priority
=============
* Breadth-first autoname
* Normal form strategy labels using your approach
* Adding commas to payoffs depending on orientation
* Fig depths fixed for each shape (this one might be really easy)
* Tree orientation mode instead of rotate buttons
* Warning before "Clear" and "Load" that the current tree will be lost
* Error feedback for user (e.g. merging invalid isets)
* Better logo for zero-sum toggle
* Possibly removing dissolve as a redundant cut feature


Nice-to-Haves
=============
BETTER ERROR HANDLING ON BOTH ENDS

REST Interface
* Output name and duration of algorithm used (perhaps tableau size and and num pivots, etc.)

Conceptual
* Make sure nothing is dependent on move ORDER for a given node... 
	I think XMLReader violates this atm when it hooks up and verifies the moves
* Complete Lrs port
* Implement LrsNash!!!
* Cut Action mouse click handling for multi-row Isets (needs improvement)
* sort Isets in the linked list by minDepth and then ltr of left most minDepth node

Display
* fig page settings (auto determine)
* BigMatrixPainter (using monospaced font and larger text block for really large matrices)
     Alos, see if I can find a quick way to drop all the labels... or is it the gc that is slowing things up
* Auto-Label should correct casing (UPPER first pl, lower second pl) for already assigned nodes
* mouse over effects (perhaps that means making iset depth groups their own child components? same with matrix squares?)
* fix drawing so labels don't run into eachother... hard to get right all the time
* try to draw all labels from a given node at the same place, taking the minimum of the children and splitting that in half
* clicking and selecting a label/outcome/strategy square (highlighting the corresponding leaf in the datagrid)
* more sophisticated leaf drawing
* align columns of payoffs in LR display
* player labels not updating on open (need to invalidate data grid display to get an update, since properties are read only?)


Refactoring
* Merge the Tableau and Dictionary classes (along with TableuVariables and LexicographicMethod classes)... they do the same thing!
* Extension to above:  Merge lrs and lcp packages into a lp (linear programming) package
* rename Presenter to Controller
* remove TreeGrid as subclass add a tree property?


Need to put some limits on dimensions of normal form or it gets out of hand with all the labels (sometimes reduced is fine, but expanded is not)

	
Better image export
* canvas dimensions setter for precise image export (separating canvas from open space somehow?)
     this needs to set the actual canvas height and width if I want the image export to work
* sizes in general need a bit of tweaking (level distance, line width, font size, etc.)?


Clique Improvement
==================
V = A U B
Get cliques of all A and all B, enumerate
Blow up the whole thing by 4
  A  B
A 1  G
B G' 1
adjacency matrices
discard the all A and all B at the end
currently it runs through the original alg twice
generating the connected components slow since it runs through all the edges (very primative, but it is not the bottleneck)

	
Some Day...
===========
3 players

Delete animation

pseudo-tree view for editing outcomes
    *short summary (num nodes, leaves, isets at top)
	*one row per leaf
	*only have moves editable once (first time the sequence prefix appears)
	*indent children rows up to new move
	*first click select, second click to edit
	*editable player ids

	complex data grid and normal form
	=================================
	Could they just be different painters on the same viewmodel?
	Or different viewmodels around the same model
	-> One viewmodel per view (and one painter per view model)
	A second complex component will really help me get the MVVM pattern in place
		They will both be modifying the underlying model and everything needs to update... should be cool :)
