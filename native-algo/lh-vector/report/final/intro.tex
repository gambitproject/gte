\section{Introduction}
The main aim of this report, is to show the progress made since the
midterm evaluations. By the midterm evaluations, the software was 
able to compute the first set of positively indexed equilibrium gotten
from the artificial equilibrium. A complete report of the progress made
can be found at \url{http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~cs0tpi/GSOC/mideval.pdf}.
In this report, an explanation of the navigation of the bipartite graph
of all possible equilibria reachable is provided. Subsequent to these are
observations and testing.
